    <h1>Xiaolongbao</h1>
    <img src="/recipes/xlb.jpg" alt="xiao long bao photo" width="500px">
    <p>Chinese Soup Dumplings, or xiaolongbao (小笼包), are perhaps the most perfect single bite of food ever conceived by man. This tantalizing, dreamy snack is probably the most famous dish to come out of the Jiangnan region of China. It is often associated with the city of Shanghai (the largest city in the region by population, and also the largest city in all of China!), which is why soup dumplings are often called “Shanghai Soup Dumplings.”</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>½ lb pork skin (225g), cut into 1-inch strips</li>
        <li>1 lb (450g) pork neck bones (you want neck bones that still have meat on them!)</li>
        <li>water</li>
        <li>2 slices ginger</li>
        <li>1 scallion, cut into 3 pieces</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon shaoxing wine</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol type="1">
        <li>In a small pot, add the pork skin and pork bones and cover with cold water. Bring to a rolling boil, and immediately drain and rinse off the bones and the skin. This gets rid of any impurities.</li>
        <li>Rinse out the pot and put everything back in. Add 4 cups (950 ml) of water along with the ginger, scallion and wine. Bring the pot to a boil and then reduce the heat to low. Cover and simmer for 2 hours.</li>
        <li>After 2 hours, turn off the heat, allow the soup to cool, and strain the liquid into a bowl. As to the leftovers in the pot, you can discard them or go the Chinese route, which would be to drizzle some light soy sauce over everything and start grazing.</li>
        <li>Once the liquid is completely cooled, cover and refrigerate overnight.</li>
        <li>In a mixing bowl, add the flour and warm water 1 tablespoon at a time. Work and knead the dough for 15-20 minutes. The dough should be very soft and smooth. Cover with a cloth and let it rest for 30 minutes.</li>
        <li>Take your ground pork and put it in the food processor. Pulse for 30-60 seconds until the pork resembles paste. In a mixing bowl, add the pork and all the rest of the ingredients except the aspic.</li>
